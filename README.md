# SiteBuildOut134B
The biggest change I made was pruning unwanted content on all three pages such as: removing buttons from main.html as they were there only for previous homeworks, I removed the theme switcher as it looked out of place in my site, and finally removed some hidden images that I had put to just satisfy requirements for previous homeworks. I also fixed some of the json as there were small errors in the project names.
